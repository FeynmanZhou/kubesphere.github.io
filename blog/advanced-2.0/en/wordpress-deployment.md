title: "Deploy a WordPress Web Application" 
---

## Objective 

In this tutorial we will create a Deployment as an example, demonstrating how to deploy [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) web application to KubeSphere, which is based on the last tutorial [Deploy a MySQL StatefulSet](mysql-statefulset.md). The password between WordPress and MySQL will be created and saved as a ConfigMap.

## Prerequisites

- You need to create a MySQL StatefulSet, see the [Tutorial 3](mysql-statefulset.md) if not yet.
- You need to sign in with `project-regular` and enter into the corresponding project.

## Hands-on Lab

### Step 1: Create a ConfigMap

1.1. Enter into `demo-project`, navigate to **Configuration Center → ConfigMaps**, then click **Create ConfigMap**.

1.3. ConfigMap parameter is composed of a set of key-value pairs, fill in the blanks with the following values and click **Create** button when you've done.

- key: WORDPRESS\_DB\_PASSWORD
- value: 123456

> Reminder: The volume will display `Pending` if it is not yet mounted, actually it's normal since local volume doesn't suppor [Dynamic Volume Provisioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/). It will change to `Bound` when it has been mounted to the workload.


#### Step 3: Create a Deployment

3.1. Navigate to **Workloads → Deployments**, then click **Create** button.

3.2. Fill in the basic information, e.g. `Name : wordpress`, then choose **Next**. 

3.3. Click **Add Container**, simply fill in the table according to the following hints. 

- Image: `wordpress:4.8-apache`
- Container Name: wordpress
- Service Settings:
   - Name: port
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Port: 80

3.4. Then check the box for **Environmental Variable**, and fill in the blanks with follow values:

- Environmental Variables (It requires to create 2 environmental variables in this section)
    - Click **Reference Config Center**
    - Fill in the name with `WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD` 
    - Select resource: select `wordpress-configmap` 
    - Select Key: `WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD`
    - Click **Add Environmental Variable**
    - Name: `WORDPRESS_DB_HOST`
    - Value: `mysql-service`

3.5. Other blanks could be remained default values, choose **Save → Next** when you've done.

3.6. Choose **Add Existing Volume**, select the `wordpress-pvc` which was created in Step 2.

3.7. Select `ReadAndWrite` and set the Mount Path to `/var/www/html`. Then click **Save → Next → Create** when you've done. Now we've created the Wordpress Deployment succeessfully.

#### Step 4: Create a Service

4.1. Navigate to **Network & Service** → **Service**, then click **Create** button.

4.2. Fill in the basic information, e.g. `Name : wordpress-service`, click **Next** and reference the following list to complete the Service Settings:

- Service Type: choose the first item `Virtual IP: Access the service through the internal IP of the cluster`
- Selector: Click **Specify Workload**, then select `wordpress` and click **Save**.
- Ports:
   - Name: port
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Port: 80  
   - Target port: 80

4.3. Click **Next → Next** to skip the Label Settings. We are going to expose this service via NodePort, so choose `NodePort` and click **Create**, the `wordpress-service` has been created successfully. We got the NodePort `30204` from the Service list.

### Step 5: Access the WordPress Application

At this point, WordPress is exposed to the outside by the Service, thus we can access this application in your browser via `{$Node IP}:{$NodePort}`, for example `http://192.168.0.88:30204` since we selected http protocol previously.
